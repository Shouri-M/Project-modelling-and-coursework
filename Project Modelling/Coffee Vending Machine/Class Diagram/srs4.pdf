
COFFEE VENDING SYSTEM
The Objective of the system is to prepare a coffee vending machine for
commercial purpose. The system will be able to prepare coffee by processing all
its required ingredients. Users will be provided with sophisticated and easy to use
user interfaces.
There are many different types of coffee makers using a number of different
brewing principles, in the most common devices, coffee grounds are placed in a
paper or metal filter inside a funnel, which is set over a glass or ceramic coffee
pot, a cooking pot in the kettle family. Cold water is poured into a separate
chamber, which is then heated up to the boiling point, and directed into the
funnel.
• Cash Box:Knows amount of money put in; Give change; Knows price of coffee;
Turns front panel on and off.
• Front panel:Captures selection; Knows what to mix in each; Instructs mixer
when to mix.
• Mixer:Knows how to talk to the dispensers.
• Dispenser [cup-, coffee powder-, sugar-, creamer-, water-]:Knows how to
dispense a fixed amount, knows when it is empty.
Features :
• Small carbon footprint
• Energy saving advanced power management system
• Comprehensive drink range
• Simple user interface
• One touch servicing
Working : Coffee vending machines are quite simple and basic. The way they
work is not too different to how a tabletop coffee machine or even a drip coffee
machine operates. If you think about it, making coffee is simply adding together
coffee beans or grounds to hot water and mixing with milk and sugar, that's
exactly what a hot drink vending machine does.
Functions :
• Add heat:to heat the coffee we have 3 options. We could use a heating element
where the water gravity fed into a tubular heating element, external to the water
reservoir, and boiled out. Secondly, we could use a submersible heating element
placed inside of the water reservoir to heat all of the water at once. Thirdly, we
could use an external hot plate to heat one or multiple walls of the water reservoir
and thus heat the water through surface convection.
• Direct Water:The fluids could be directed from the water reservoir to their final
destination via tubing, gravity reed, and pump.
• Contain Water/Coffee:To contain the water and coffee we could use one
reservoir, two reservoirs or a funnel. If one reservoir was used for both the water
and coffee container, our design would be a percolating or French press
coffeemaker.
• Reduce Noise:To reduce the overall noise we consider two options: noise
dampening material and internal brew mechanism. To lessen the noise produced
by our designs we could fill or cover the outer shell of a noise dampening
material. We could also keep the brew mechanism, whether it is drip spout.
Maintenance:
When it comes to the ways in which coffee vending machines work, it’s not all
about the coffee, it’s also about the upkeep and maintenance of the machine.
With regular visits, suppliers should empty the cash drawer, reconcile the
proceeds against sales, empty the waste grounds, refill ingredients and cups,
and generally undertake any work to both the interior and exterior to keep
everything running smoothly, such as ensuring there’s no build up of dirt around
the exterior buttons that could cause them to stick, and making sure nothing is
blocking the internal sensors that could prevent some ingredients from being
added to the mixing chamber.
